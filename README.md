<font size=4><div align='center' > [[ü§ó Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaxiongwang/mdsm-dataset-under-review/data)] </div></font>

## üî• Overview

We propose MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (**MDSM**), a large scale,  semantic-aligned multi-modal benchmark with  high-fidelity texts from MLLM, supporting fake news detecting and grounding tasks.

And AMDxxxxxx



## Setup

```shell
conda create -n AMD python=3.10
conda activate AMD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you encounter issues with flash-attn, you can fix it with the following command:

```shell
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Alternatively, you can visit the [flash-attention releases page](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases) to find the version compatible with your environment and follow the installation instructions provided there.

## Data

Our dataset now is avaliable at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yaxiongwang/mdsm-dataset-under-review/data).

You can also prepare your training or inference data like:

```

        ],
        "mtcnn_boxes": [
            [
                64,
                48,
                145,

                285
            ]
        ]
    },
]
```

## Inference

We provide an example here

```shell
cd evaluation/
bash test.sh
```

Please fill the MODEL_PATH, IMG_PATH, TEST_JSON with your real checkpoint path and data path.

## Training

```shell
cd src/script/
bash train.sh
```
